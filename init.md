When creating a portfolio or providing direct links to showcase your work, consider the following:

**Personal Website**: Build a personal website where you can showcase your projects, share blog posts, and provide information about your skills and experience. Include links to specific projects you have worked on and highlight your contributions.

**GitHub or GitLab Repositories**: If you have contributed to open-source projects or have personal projects hosted on platforms like GitHub or GitLab, provide links to your repositories. This allows potential employers or collaborators to see your code and contributions.

**Data Science Competitions**: If you have participated in data science competitions, such as Kaggle, provide links to your competition profiles. Highlight your achievements, rankings, and any awarded medals or achievements you have earned.

**Online Data Science Platforms**: If you have worked on data science projects using platforms like DataCamp, Dataquest, or Udacity, include links to your profiles or any public projects you have completed on these platforms.
**
LinkedIn Profile**: Ensure your LinkedIn profile is up to date and includes a detailed description of your work experience, projects, and skills. Provide links to relevant projects or external resources in the descriptions of your roles.

Remember, it's important to keep your portfolio updated and showcase your best work. Providing direct links to demonstrate your skills and expertise can greatly enhance your credibility and make it easier for others to assess your abilities.
